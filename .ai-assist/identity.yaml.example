    I manage a team of 8 engineers working on OpenShift CI/CD infrastructure.

    Team structure:
    - Senior Engineers: Sarah (authentication, 10y exp), Marcus (networking, 8y exp)

    - Junior: Maria (just joined, learning DCI), Raj (6 months, focus on Jira automation)
    - Contractor: Jamie (part-time, handles documentation)

    Key areas:
    - DCI (Distributed CI): Alex leads, Chen supports
    - OpenShift testing: Jordan and Marcus collaborate
    - Authentication/security: Sarah owns, I review

    Current priorities:
    - Migrate DCI to new infrastructure (Q1 2026)
    - Reduce test flakiness by 50%
    - Onboard Maria successfully
