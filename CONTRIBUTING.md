# Contributing to ai-assist

## Development Setup

### 1. Install Development Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs:
- pytest (testing framework)
- pre-commit (git hooks)
- black (code formatting)
- isort (import sorting)
- ruff (fast linting)

### 2. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This installs git hooks that will automatically:
- Format code with black
- Sort imports with isort
- Lint code with ruff
- Fix trailing whitespace and line endings
- Run tests with pytest

### 3. Manual Testing

Run tests manually:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_filesystem_tools.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run only fast tests (skip slow/integration tests)
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### 4. Code Quality

Run quality checks manually:

```bash
# Format code
black ai_assist tests

# Sort imports
isort ai_assist tests

# Lint code
ruff check ai_assist tests

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix ai_assist tests
```

Or run all checks at once:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you commit. They include:

### Formatting
- **black**: Formats Python code to a consistent style (120 char line length)
- **isort**: Sorts and organizes imports

### Linting
- **ruff**: Fast Python linter (checks for errors, style issues, bugs)

### Basic Checks
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Fix end-of-file issues
- Check YAML/JSON/TOML syntax
- Prevent large files (>500KB)
- Check for merge conflicts
- Detect debug statements (pdb, etc.)

### Testing
- **pytest**: Runs all tests to ensure changes don't break functionality

## Commit Workflow

```bash
# Make your changes
vim ai_assist/some_file.py

# Stage changes
git add ai_assist/some_file.py

# Commit (pre-commit hooks run automatically)
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# If hooks fail, fix issues and try again
# The hooks will show you what needs to be fixed
```

## Skipping Hooks (Not Recommended)

If you absolutely need to skip hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only skip hooks for emergency fixes. Your PR may be rejected if code doesn't pass quality checks.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Line Length
- Maximum 120 characters per line
- Let black handle most formatting

### Imports
- Standard library imports first
- Third-party imports second
- Local imports last
- Sorted alphabetically within each group

### Type Hints
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Example: `def read_file(path: str) -> str:`

### Docstrings
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Format: Google style or NumPy style

Example:
```python
def read_file(path: str, line_start: int = None) -> str:
    """Read a file from the filesystem.

    Args:
        path: Absolute path to the file
        line_start: Optional starting line number

    Returns:
        File contents as string

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
    """
```

## Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Run only filesystem tool tests
pytest tests/test_filesystem_tools.py

# Run only agent tests
pytest tests/test_agent*.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=ai_assist --cov-report=html

# Run tests in parallel (requires pytest-xdist)
pytest -n auto
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

If tests fail during pre-commit:

```bash
# Run tests manually to see full output
pytest -v

# Run specific failing test
pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function -v

# Run with print statements visible
pytest -s
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality, add corresponding tests:

1. Create test file: `tests/test_your_feature.py`
2. Import pytest and your module:
   ```python
   import pytest
   from ai_assist.your_module import YourClass
   ```
3. Write test functions:
   ```python
   def test_your_function():
       result = your_function("test")
       assert result == "expected"
   ```
4. For async functions:
   ```python
   async def test_async_function():
       result = await async_function()
       assert result == "expected"
   ```

## Continuous Integration

Pre-commit hooks run the same checks that will run in CI/CD, so:
- ✅ If pre-commit passes, CI will likely pass
- ❌ If pre-commit fails, CI will definitely fail

Fix issues locally before pushing!

## Questions?

If you have questions about:
- Pre-commit setup: Check `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Tool configuration: Check `pyproject.toml`
- Test configuration: Check `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in `pyproject.toml`

## Quick Reference

```bash

# Setup hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests
pytest

# Format code
black ai_assist tests

# Lint code
ruff check --fix ai_assist tests
```
