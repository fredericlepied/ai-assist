━━━ AWL SYNTAX REFERENCE ━━━

## Structure

Every script starts with @start and ends with @end:

  @start
    ... directives ...
  @end

## Directives

  @task <id> [hints]     — agent task block
  Goal: <text>           — what to achieve (required)
  Context: <text>        — additional context (optional)
  Constraints: <text>    — limitations (optional)
  Success: <text>        — completion criteria (optional)
  Expose: var1, var2     — variables to extract from the agent response
  @end

  @set <var> = <value>   — assign a variable (literal or ${interpolation})

  @if <expr>             — conditional
    ...
  @else
    ...
  @end

  @loop <collection> as <item> [limit=N] [collect=<var>[(<fields>)]]
    ...
  @end

  @return <expr>         — return workflow result
  @fail <message>        — abort the workflow immediately with an error message
                           (combine with @if to abort conditionally)

## Task Hints (placed after task id)

  @no-history    agent ignores prior conversation history
  @no-kg         agent does not consult the knowledge graph

## Variables

  @set x = "literal"    assign a string
  @set x = ${y}         copy from another variable
  ${varname}            interpolation in any text field

## Expressions (used in @if conditions and @loop collections)

  handlers              variable truthiness
  not report_exists     negation
  len(handlers) > 0     length comparison (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
  handlers[0]           index access
  config.entrypoint     property access

## Collecting Loop Results

  @loop items as item collect=results
  collect=results(field1,field2)   — collect only specific exposed fields

After the loop, `results` is a list of dicts from each successful iteration.

## Initial Variables (injected before the script runs)

  CLI:   ai-assist /run workflow.awl key=value
  Agent: call introspection__execute_awl_script with variables={"key": "value"}

## Complete Example

  @start

  @task find_handlers @no-kg
  Goal: Find all HTTP handlers in the repository.
  Expose: handlers
  @end

  @if len(handlers) > 0

    @loop handlers as handler limit=5 collect=summaries

      @task inspect_handler @no-history
      Goal: Understand what ${handler} does.
      Expose: handler_summary
      @end

    @end

  @else

    @task fallback_search
    Goal: Search more broadly for request entry points.
    Expose: handlers
    @end

  @end

  @return handlers

  @end
