# Creating Personal Skills

This guide shows you how to create and manage local Agent Skills for your personal use.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Skills Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/skills-personal
```

### 2. Create a New Skill

Use the helper script:

```bash
# From ai-assist repository
./scripts/create-skill ~/skills-personal home-automation "Control smart home devices"

# Or if ai-assist is installed
python -m ai_assist.scripts.create-skill ~/skills-personal meal-planning
```

### 3. Customize the Skill

Edit the generated `SKILL.md`:

```bash
cd ~/skills-personal/home-automation
$EDITOR SKILL.md
```

### 4. Install the Skill

```bash
ai-assist /interactive
/skill/install ~/skills-personal/home-automation@main
```

Changes auto-reload when you edit the skill file!

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a directory containing:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: Main skill definition
├── README.md         # Optional: Documentation
├── scripts/          # Optional: Executable scripts
├── references/       # Optional: Context documents
└── assets/           # Optional: Images, data files
```

## SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file has two parts:

### 1. YAML Frontmatter (Required)

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill does
license: MIT
compatibility: ai-assist
---
```

**Fields:**
- `name` - Skill name (lowercase, hyphens, must match directory name)
- `description` - Brief description (1-1024 chars)
- `license` - Optional license identifier
- `compatibility` - Optional compatibility note

### 2. Markdown Body (Your Instructions)

This is where you tell the AI how to behave with this skill:

```markdown
# My Skill

You are an AI assistant with knowledge about [topic].

## Instructions

- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
- Preference or constraint

## Examples

### Example Usage

**User**: How do I...?

**Assistant**: You can do this by...

Since it's evening, I'll set them to 60% brightness with a warm white
color temperature. Would you like me to proceed?

### Check Temperature

**User**: What's the temperature?

**Assistant**: The Nest thermostat shows the current temperature is 70°F,
which is within your preferred range (68-72°F). The target is currently
set to 70°F. Would you like to adjust it?

## Managing Personal Skills

### Install a Skill

```bash
ai-assist /interactive
/skill/install ~/skills-personal/my-skill@main
```

### Update a Skill

Just edit the `SKILL.md` file - changes auto-reload:

```bash
cd ~/skills-personal/my-skill
vim SKILL.md
# Changes apply automatically!
```

### List Installed Skills

```bash
ai-assist /interactive
/skill/list
```

### Uninstall a Skill

```bash
ai-assist /interactive
/skill/uninstall my-skill
```

### Reinstall After Major Changes

If auto-reload doesn't pick up changes:

```bash
/skill/uninstall my-skill
/skill/install ~/skills-personal/my-skill@main
```

## Advanced Features

### Scripts Directory

Add executable scripts that AI can reference:

```bash
~/skills-personal/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    ├── backup.sh
    └── deploy.py
```

**Important**: Script execution requires enabling in config:
```bash
export AI_ASSIST_ALLOW_SCRIPT_EXECUTION=true
```

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for details.

### References Directory

Add text files for additional context:

```bash
~/skills-personal/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── api-docs.md
    └── examples.txt
```

These are loaded and available to the AI.

### Assets Directory

Add data files, images, etc.:

```bash
~/skills-personal/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── assets/
    ├── config.json
    └── diagram.png
```

## Tips for Effective Skills

### 1. Start Small

Begin with simple skills focused on one topic:
- ✅ `home-automation` - Smart home control
- ❌ `everything-personal` - Too broad

### 2. Be Specific

Include concrete examples and preferences:
```markdown
## Preferences
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
- Use 2-space indentation
- Write tests first (TDD)
```

### 3. Add Context

Include your workflows and patterns:
```markdown
## My Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Write tests first
3. Implement feature
4. Run `npm test && npm run lint`
5. Create PR with [template](../pr-template.md)
```

### 4. Use Examples

Show the AI how you want it to respond:
```markdown
### Example: Code Review

**User**: Review this code

**Assistant**: I'll review following your preferences:
- TypeScript types: ✅ All properly typed
- Tests: ⚠️ Missing test for edge case X
- Style: ✅ Follows 2-space indentation
...
```

### 5. Iterate

Update skills based on what works:
- If AI forgets something, add it to the skill
- If responses are too verbose, add verbosity guidance
- If AI makes wrong assumptions, clarify in examples

## Organizing Multiple Skills

### By Domain

```
~/skills-personal/
├── work/
│   ├── code-review/
│   ├── documentation/
│   └── deployment/
└── personal/
    ├── home-automation/
    ├── meal-planning/
    └── fitness/
```

### By Activity

```
~/skills-personal/
├── daily/
│   ├── morning-routine/
│   ├── work-planning/
│   └── evening-review/
├── weekly/
│   ├── meal-prep/
│   └── house-chores/
└── projects/
    ├── home-renovation/
    └── learning-spanish/
```

## Sharing Skills

To share a skill:

```bash
# 1. Copy to git repository
cp -r ~/skills-personal/my-skill ~/my-skills-repo/

# 2. Commit and push
cd ~/my-skills-repo
git add my-skill/
git commit -m "Add my-skill"
git push

# 3. Others can install
ai-assist /interactive
/skill/install github-user/my-skills-repo/my-skill@main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Loading

Check the skill name matches directory:
```bash
# Directory name
ls ~/skills-personal/
# -> my-skill/

# Name in SKILL.md
grep "^name:" ~/skills-personal/my-skill/SKILL.md
# -> name: my-skill  ✅
```

### Changes Not Applying

1. Check installed-skills.json:
```bash
cat ~/.ai-assist/installed-skills.json
```

2. Reinstall if needed:
```bash
/skill/uninstall my-skill
/skill/install ~/skills-personal/my-skill@main
```

### Invalid Skill Format

Validate YAML frontmatter:
```bash
# Extract frontmatter and validate
python3 << 'EOF'
import yaml
with open('/home/flepied/skills-personal/my-skill/SKILL.md') as f:
    content = f.read()
    if content.startswith('---'):
        parts = content.split('---', 2)
        metadata = yaml.safe_load(parts[1])
        print("✅ Valid YAML")
        print(metadata)
EOF
```
